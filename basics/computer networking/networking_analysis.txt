      2. DNS (regular DNS and Multicast DNS, both over IPv4 UDP)

Question 2: How many DNS queries were made in total?
Answer: 358 DNS queries were made, identified using the filter dns.flags.response == 0 in Wireshark.

Question 3: What types of DNS queries were made?
Answer: The DNS queries included the following record types:
- A (IPv4 address)
- AAAA (IPv6 address)
- PTR (Pointer record for reverse DNS lookups)
- HTTPS (Used to discover service binding and parameters)
These were observed by applying the filter 'dns.flags.response == 0' and checking the Info column in Wireshark.

Question 4: What is a Loopback Interface?
Answer: A loopback interface is a virtual network interface used by a system to send and receive its own traffic. 
It is commonly associated with the IP address 127.0.0.1 and is used for testing or internal communication within the host. 
Packets sent to the loopback do not go out to the physical network.

Question 5: How many .txt files were requested? List their names.
Answer: There were 3 .txt files requested via HTTP GET requests:

- encoded.txt
- decoy1.txt

Question 6: One .txt file contains base64-encoded content. Identify and decode it. What does it contain?

Answer: The file 'encoded.txt' contains base64-encoded content.  
After decoding the string `RkxBR3tzcGlkM3JfbmV0d29ya19tYXN0ZXJ9Cg==`, it reveals the text:  
`FLAG{spid3r_network_master}`.

Question 7: Was any attempt made to distract the analyst using decoy files? Explain.
Answer: Yes, two decoy files named 'decoy1.txt' and 'decoy2.txt' were requested.

Answer: There are 3 HTTP GET requests visible in the capture:
- GET /decoy2.txt
- GET /encoded.txt
- GET /decoy1.txt
